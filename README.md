## `Overview of the Mapping_Earthquakes Analysis`	
	
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven day. 

To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.
This project consists of three technical following analysis deliverables:
  1. Add Tectonic Plate Data
  2. Add Major Earthquake Data
  3. Add an Additional Map.
## `Resources`	

use the JavaScript and the D3.js library. To retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. To plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data by using the Leaflet library.

The analysis was created using next software: JavaScript, GeoJSON, VScode, Mapbox of the Leaflet.js.
