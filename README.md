This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables. You will submit the following:

Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

## `Overview of the Mapping_Earthquake`	
	
The purpose for the analysis is 
to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, 
and to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, 
and to see the data on a third map https://itekkie.github.io/-----/.

This assignment consists of four following technical analyses:
  1. Add Tectonic Plate Data to the overlay object with the earthquake data by using d3.json(), geoJSON() layer, and to set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map;
  2. Add Major Earthquake Data;
  3. Add an Additional Map.
## `Resources`	
The analysis was created by using next software: HTML 5, CSS 4, JavaScript, JS Libraries: Leaflet, D3.
## `Mapping_Earthquake Analysis Summary`	

Next charts are created:
