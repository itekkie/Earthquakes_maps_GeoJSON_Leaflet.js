## `Overview of the Mapping Earthquake`	
	
The purpose of the analysis is to show the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map.

This assignment consists of three following technical analyses:
  1. Add Tectonic Plate Data to the overlay object with the earthquake data by using d3.json(), geoJSON() layer, and to set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map;
  2. Add Major Earthquake Data by using d3.json(), and a color and set the radius of the circle based on the magnitude of earthquake, and add a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON();
  3. Add a third "Dark" map style to the Earthquake map.
## `Resources`	
The analysis was created by using next software: HTML 5, CSS 4, JavaScript, JS Libraries: Leaflet, D3.

Next tasks are completed: 
  - Tectonic Plate Data is added to the overlay object with the earthquake data, and the tectonic plate LineString data stands out on the map.

  - Major Earthquake Data ia added with three colors and the radius of the circle based on the magnitude of earthquake. Also, a popup marker with the magnitude and location is added.
