## `Overview of the Mapping_Earthquake`	
	
The purpose for the analysis is 
to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, 
and to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, 
and to see the data on a third map https://itekkie.github.io/-----/.

This assignment consists of four following technical analyses:
  1. Add Tectonic Plate Data to the overlay object with the earthquake data by using d3.json(), geoJSON() layer, and to set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map;
  2. Add Major Earthquake Data by using d3.json(), and a color and set the radius of the circle based on the magnitude of earthquake, and add a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON();
  3. Add an Additional Map.
## `Resources`
